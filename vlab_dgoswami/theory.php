<font face="Purisa">Quantum properties dominate the fields of atomic and molecular physics. Radiation is quantized such 
that for a given frequency of radiation, there can be only one value of quantum energy for the photons of that radiation. 
The energy levels of atoms and molecules can have only certain quantized values. Transitions between these quantized states 
occur by the photon processes absorption, emission, and stimulated emission. All of these processes require that the photon 
energy given by the Planck relationship is equal to the energy separation of the participating pair of quantum energy states.

(an upper energy level, in contrast to its lowest possible level or "ground state"), then an incoming photon for which the quantum energy is equal to
 the energy difference between its present level and a lower level can "stimulate" a transition to that lower level, producing a second photon of the same energy.

<font face="Purisa">When a sizable population of electrons resides in upper levels, this condition is called a "population inversion", and it sets the stage for
 stimulated emission of multiple photons. This is the precondition for the light amplification which occurs in a laser, and since the emitted photons have a definite
 time and phase relation to each other, the light has a high degree of coherence.

</div>
<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1">
<font face="Purisa">Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM or LSCM) is a technique for obtaining high-resolution optical images with depth selectivity.[1] 
The key feature of confocal microscopy is its ability to acquire in-focus images from selected depths, a process known as optical sectioning. Images are acquired 
point-by-point and reconstructed with a computer, allowing three-dimensional reconstructions of topologically complex objects. For opaque specimens, this is useful 
for surface profiling, while for non-opaque specimens, interior structures can be imaged. For interior imaging, the quality of the image is greatly enhanced over 
simple microscopy because image information from multiple depths in the specimen is not superimposed. A conventional microscope "sees" as far into the specimen as 
the light can penetrate, while a confocal microscope only images one depth level at a time. In effect, the CLSM achieves a controlled and highly limited depth of 
focus.

of Confocal Microscopy</font>
</div>
<br>

<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1">
<font face="Purisa">In a confocal laser scanning microscope, a laser beam passes through a light source aperture and then is focused by an objective lens into a 
small (ideally diffraction limited) focal volume within or on the surface of a specimen. In biological applications especially, the specimen may be fluorescent. 
Scattered and reflected laser light as well as any fluorescent light from the illuminated spot is then re-collected by the objective lens. A beam splitter separates 
off some portion of the light into the detection apparatus, which in fluorescence confocal microscopy will also have a filter that selectively passes the fluorescent 
wavelengths while blocking the original excitation wavelength. After passing a pinhole, the light intensity is detected by a photodetection device (usually a 
photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche photodiode), transforming the light signal into an electrical one that is recorded by a computer.

<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1">

Kerr nonlinearity and the non-linear absorption 
coefficient &amp;delta&amp;alpha via the "open" and "closed" methods respectively. As nonlinear absorption can affect the measurement of the non-linear index the 
open method is typically used in conjunction with the closed method to correct the calculated value. </font></div>

<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1">
<font face="Purisa">Closed Aperture Z-scan Technique : In this setup an aperture is placed to prevent some of the light from reaching the detector. The equipment is 
arranged as can be seen in the diagram. A lens focuses a laser to a certain point, and after this point the beam naturally defocuses. After a further distance an 
aperture is placed with a detector behind it. The aperture causes only the central region of the cone of light to reach the detector. Typically values of the 
normalised transmittance are between 0.1 &lt; S &lt; 0.5. </font></div>
<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1"><font face="Purisa">Open Aperture Z-scan Technique : This method is 
similar to the above method, however the aperture is removed or enlarged to allow all the light to reach the detector. This in effect sets the normalised 
transmittance to S = 1. This is used in order to measure the non-linear absorption coefficient &amp;delta&amp;alpha .

<br>
<div align="center" id="theory_text_style_1"><font face="Purisa">Optical tweezers are capable of manipulating nanometer and micrometer-sized dielectric particles by exerting 
extremely small
 forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a microscope objective. The narrowest point of the focused beam, known 
as the beam waist, contains a very strong electric field gradient. It turns out that dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest 
electric field, which is the center of the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. It is 
easy to understand why if one considers light to be a group of particles, each impinging on the tiny dielectric particle in its path. This is known as the scattering 
force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist. </font>
